  This is only an 8-mer because it was a fragment-based approach to resolving a larger protein (




Before, we were running on the assumption that there would be peptides *for which there was a PDB file* and *for which there was not already a story*

How those assumptions have not been met:

  There are no 8-mers in the database that are truly just 8-mers that we could try against proteins.

  Lots of the peptides don't interact with proteins, they interact with cell walls.

  It would take a LOT of time to try even the few peptides that there are against the most important proteins.

  There is a small likelihood that the peptide even interacts with one of those proteins.

  Among the peptides that have already been resolved, generally the authors have already done other biological assays to tell the story of 
  the peptide

  We might be better off compiling those stories and trying to catch a general mode of action to particular motifs -- more of a metaanalysis



Because so many of these peptides that have 3-dimentinoal structures have already been resolved, perhaps it is best to look at smoe of 
the mootifs to try and find a common theme between the modes of action of any one particular motif?
