  This is only an 8-mer because it was a fragment-based approach to resolving a larger protein (



Before, we were running on the assumption that there would be peptides 
  *for which there was a PDB file* and 
  *for which there was not already a story*

How those assumptions have not been met:

  There are no 8-mers in the database that are truly just 8-mers that we could try against proteins. That I have found yet.
    I want to talk with Kristi more about where we got our list of known AMP's etc. and look at those files
        If we don't have anything to work with, I'm not sure how meaningful this is going to be.
  
  Many of the peptides do not interact with proteins, they interact with cell walls.

  It would take a LOT of time to try even the few peptides for which PDB files exist against the most important proteins.

  There is a small likelihood that the peptide even interacts with one of those proteins.
      Lots of time investment with little promise of reward

  Among the peptides that have already been resolved, generally the authors have already done other biological assays to tell the story of 
  the peptide. And some of those stories are pretty neat.

  We might be better off compiling those stories and trying to catch a general mode of action to particular motifs -- more of a metaanalysis

Problems with abandoning Autodoc for the time being:
  No eye candy
