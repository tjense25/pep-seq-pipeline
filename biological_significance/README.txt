# Biological Significance
==========
This folder contains several files that document the biological significance of the output from the pip-seq-pipline

## Contents:

### Essential Genes:
This is a list of genes proposed to be the most critical to maintaining homeostasis (normal cell function) in E. coli
Page Author: 

### Dallon_Analysis
This is a list of the peptides from Emma Dallon's masters thesis* that matched the motifs generated by the pipeline
Page Author:

*Dallon's thesis is called: "Exploration of Antimicrobial Activity in Natural Peptides and High-Throughput Discovery of Synthetic Peptides"

### KnownAMP.csv
This file contains the sequences of known antimicrobial peptides, and the antimicrobial peptide databases from which they came
Page Author:

### KnownAMP_Intersect_Our_Motifs
This file contains a table of the known AMPs that matched the motifs generated by the pipeline, as well as any published information we could find about the peptide.
