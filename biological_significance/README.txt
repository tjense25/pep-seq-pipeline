# Biological Significance
==========
This folder contains several files that document the biological significance of the output from the pip-seq-pipline.

Our main approach in establishing biological significance was to search the literature for publications that confirmed the toxic nature of the motifs (see "knownAMP_Intersect_Our_Motifs")

## Contents:

### Essential Genes:
This is a list of genes proposed to be the most critical to maintaining homeostasis (normal cell function) in E. coli

### dallon_Analysis.csv
This is a list of the peptides from Emma Dallon's masters thesis* that matched the motifs generated by the pipeline. This file was generated using motifFinder.py
Page Author: Brian

*Dallon's thesis is called: "Exploration of Antimicrobial Activity in Natural Peptides and High-Throughput Discovery of Synthetic Peptides"

### dallons_peptides.csv
This file contains the 

### KnownAMP.csv
This file contains the sequences of known antimicrobial peptides, and the antimicrobial peptide databases from which they came
Page Author: Kristi

### KnownAMP_Intersect_Our_Motifs.csv
This file contains a table of the known AMPs that matched the motifs generated by the pipeline, as well as any published information we could find about the peptide. This file was generated using motifFinder.py
Page Author: Brian

### motifs.csv
the file of motifs used to generate knownAMP_Intersect_Our_Motifs adn Dallon_Analysis
Page Author: Kristi

### motifFinder.py
A python script that takes an input file of motifs, and searches for those motifs in another input file of peptide sequences.
