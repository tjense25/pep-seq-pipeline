# Biological Significance
==========
This folder contains several files that document the biological significance of the output from the pip-seq-pipline

Contents:

### Essential Genes:
This is a list of genes proposed to be the most critical to maintaining homeostasis (normal cell function) in E. coli

### Dallon_Analysis
This is a list of the peptides from Emma Dallon's masters thesis* that matched the motifs generated by the pipeline
