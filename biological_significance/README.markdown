# Biological Significance

This folder contains several files that document the biological significance of the output from the pep-seq-pipline.

Our main approach in establishing biological significance was to search the literature for publications that confirmed the toxic nature of the motifs (see "knownAMP_Intersect_Our_Motifs")

## Contents:

### [Essential_Genes](../biological_significance/Essential_Genes.txt)

This is a published list of genes proposed to be the most critical to maintaining homeostasis (normal cell function) in E. coli. We are not currently using it as part of the analysis, but it might be handy in the future.

### [dallon_analysis.markdown](../biological_significance/dallon_analysis.markdown)

A summary of the number of our motifs that matched the peptide sequences from Figure 23 (page 53) and Table 6 (page 49) of Emma Dallon's master's thesis* (all data used are listed in the file and are available in this directory).

*Dallon's thesis is called: "Exploration of Antimicrobial Activity in Natural Peptides and High-Throughput Discovery of Synthetic Peptides"

### [dallon_analysis_number_2.png](../biological_significance/dallon_analysis_number_2.png)

### [dallon_intersect_our_motifs.csv](../biological_significance/dallon_intersect_our_motifs.csv)

This file contains the data that is summarized in [dallon_analysis.markdown](../biological_significance/dallon_analysis.markdown) and was produced usuing [motifFinder.py](../biological_significance/motifFinder.py). It contains the motifs from the PepSeq pipeline that matched the peptides available in [dallons_peptides.csv](../biological_significance/dallons_peptides.csv)

Page Author: Brian

### [dallons_in_depth_peptides.csv](../biological_significance/dallons_in_depth_peptides.csv)

This file contains peptides that Emma Dallon studied in depth in her master's thesis. The data was obtained by examinig the thesis document.

### [KnownAMP.csv](../biological_significance/knownAMP.csv)

This file contains the sequences of known antimicrobial peptides, and the antimicrobial peptide databases from which they came.

Page Author: Kristi

### [knownAMP_intersect_ourMotifs.csv](../biological_significance/knownAMP_intersect_ourMotifs.csv)

This file contains a table of the known AMPs that matched the motifs generated by the pipeline, as well as any published information we could find about the peptide. This file was generated using [motifFinder.py](../biological_significance/motifFinder.py)

Page Author: Brian

### [most_toxic.csv](../biological_significance/most_toxic.csv)

This file contains data from Table 6 on page 49 of Emma's thesis.

Page Author: Brian

### [most_toxic_intersect_our_motifs](../biological_significance/most_toxic_intersect_our_motifs)

This file contains the output from [motifFinder.py](../biological_significance/motifFinder.py) on [most_toxic.csv](../biological_significance/most_toxic.csv). The data are summarized in the second table in [dallon_analysis.markdown](../biological_significance/dallon_analysis.markdown).

Page Author: Brian

### [motifFinder.py](../biological_significance/motifFinder.py)

A python script that takes an input file of motifs, and searches for those motifs in another input file of peptide sequences.

Page Author: Brian

### [motifs.csv](../biological_significance/motifs.csv)

the file of motifs used to generate knownAMP_Intersect_Our_Motifs adn Dallon_Analysis

Page Author: Kristi

### [notes.txt](../biological_significance/notes.txt)

A space where Brian has kept track of random things he has learned that might someday be useful for this project.

Page Author: Brian

### [pdb_files_length_8.txt](../biological_significance/pdb_files_length_8.txt)

A list with links to PDB entries for peptides of length 8. We gathered this information thinking we could somehow use it to perform an autodoc molecular dynamics analysis on other PDB entries of known proteins in E. coli. We have, for the time being, given up on this idea. However, *it would be interesting to see if these peptides contain our motifs!*

### [permutationTest2.R](../biological_significance/permutationTest2.R)

An R script used in [dallon_analysis.markdown](../biological_significance/dallon_analysis.markdown). The script performs a permutation test on the number of motifs that matched canonical and non canonical toxic peptides.
