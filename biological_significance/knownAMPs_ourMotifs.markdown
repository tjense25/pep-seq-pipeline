# Known AMPs_ourMotifs

This document is a write up of the most important discoveries from the knownAMP_intersect_our_motifs.csv document.

## Most important Peptides/motifs:

### 1) Temporin-SHF : FFFLSRIF

**Number of matching motifs:** 5

**Mode of action:** Temporin-SHF targets the membranes of bacteria. It likely acts as a detergent, preferentially disrupting bacterial membranes likely by the ["carpet method"](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/A-model-of-a-carpet-like-mechanism-for-membrane-disruption-In-this-model-the-peptides_fig2_23981203).

**canonical:** The peptide is **highly canonical**; it has a net charge of +2, and, at 50% phenylalanine, has a high level of hydrophobicity.

**eye candy:** Figure 9 contains a nice 3-dimentional model of the conformation the peptide takes when interacting with a micel (a dissintigrated portion of a bacterial membrane).

**biological proof**: A variety of assays demonstate the antimicrobial nature of the peptide.

### 2)	pleurostrin : VRPYLVAF

**Number of matching motifs:** 3

**Mode of action:** The mode of action isn't explicitely given in the study. However, the authors report results from an assay in which ribosomal activity was reduced in response to pleurostrin. This finding is consistent with [other antifungal peptides](https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/bchm.2003.384.issue-5/bc.2003.090/bc.2003.090.xml), which also decrease the speed of ribosomal activity. This may indicate that pleurostrin interacts with ribosomes to decrease cell proliferation.

**canonical:** *no data given in the study*.

**eye candy:** Figure 4 shows side-by-side the effect of pleurostrin on strains of fungi that cause harm to crops. 

**biological proof**  One assay was used to determine antifungal activity, while a second assay was used to determine the peptides effect on ribosomal efficiency. This peptide is a little interesting because it is an *antifungal* peptide isolated *from a fungus!*

### 3) Cr‐ACP1 : WKLFDDGV

**Number of matching motifs:** 2

**Mode of action:** Seems to target DNA (based on *in vitro* binding studies)
 > The Trp2 residue was positioned between two hydrophilic branches and inserted into two nucleotide bases that assist in a “hydrophilic hug.” Coleman and Oakley [1980] observed that this might be an important factor in the recognition of single‐stranded nucleic acids by single‐strand binding proteins. The insertion of an aromatic amino acid side chain into an apurinic site might form the basis for the selective recognition of such sites in apurinic DNA [Behmoaras et al., 1981b]. As observed with the peptide isolated here, **the presence of hydrophobic residues surrounding cationic residues is observed in 80% of peptides with anticancer activity.** deposited on APD2 [Behmoaras et al., 1981a].

**canonical:** No (I think)

**eye candy:** Figure 4 is probably the best figure this analysis found.

**biological proof** Chemical modificiation (acetylation) weakened the anticancer and antimicrobial activity. Molecular modeling was used to demonstrate how the peptide could bind to DNA.

**fun fact:** This peptide comes from a plant in the Cycad Family, which means it is related to those plants that look like a cross between pineapples and palm trees that you see in depictions of dinosaur landscapes.

## General summary:

#### The mystery of bradykinins

Many of the peptides were *bradykinins*. This is a bit puzzling at first, since bradykinins are a class of inflamatory mediators that, in humans, bind to the B1 and B2 receptors to trigger various inflamatory responses--nothing to do with antimicrobial activity. The fourth intance of "bradykinin" in [this article](http://www.jbc.org/content/280/41/34832.full) was the closest thing I could find in terms of evidence in the literature that bradkykinins have antimicrobial activity.


#### Bacteroicins
