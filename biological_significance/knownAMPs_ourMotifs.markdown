# Known AMPs_ourMotifs

This document is a write up of the most important discoveries from the knownAMP_intersect_our_motifs.csv document.

## Most important Peptides/motifs:

### 1) Temporin-SHF : FFFLSRIF

**Number of matching motifs:** 5

**Mode of action:** Temporin-SHF targets the membranes of bacteria. It likely acts as a detergent, preferentially disrupting bacterial membranes likely by the ["carpet method"](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/A-model-of-a-carpet-like-mechanism-for-membrane-disruption-In-this-model-the-peptides_fig2_23981203).

**canonical:** The peptide is **highly canonical**; it has a net charge of +2, and, at 50% phenylalanine, has a high level of hydrophobicity.

**eye candy:** Figure 9 contains a nice 3-dimentional model of the conformation the peptide takes when interacting with a micel (a dissintigrated portion of a bacterial membrane).

**biological proof**: A variety of assays demonstate the antimicrobial nature of the peptide.

## General summary:

#### The mystery of bradykinins

Many of the peptides were *bradykinins*. This is a bit puzzling at first, since bradykinins are a class of inflamatory mediators that, in humans, bind to the B1 and B2 receptors to trigger various inflamatory responses--nothing to do with antimicrobial activity. The fourth intance of "bradykinin" in [this article](http://www.jbc.org/content/280/41/34832.full) was the closest thing I could find in terms of evidence in the literature that bradkykinins have antimicrobial activity.


#### Bacteroicins
