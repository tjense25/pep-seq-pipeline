### Most important Peptides/motifs:


### General summary:

#### Bradykinins

Many of the peptides were *bradykinins*. This is a bit puzzling at first, since bradykinins are a class of inflamatory mediators that, in humans, bind to the B1 and B2 receptors to trigger various inflamatory responses--nothing to do with antimicrobial activity. The fourth intance of "bradykinin" in [this article](http://www.jbc.org/content/280/41/34832.full) was the closest thing I could find in terms of evidence in the literature that bradkykinins have antimicrobial activity.
