In the CS418 Bioinformatics class, the students learned various motif finding algorithms. These algorithms include greedy algorithms, randomized algorithms, and Gibbs sampling. They output a consensus string representing a motif. More information about the motif finding techniques used can be found at http://bioinformaticsinstitute.ru/sites/default/files/an_introduction_to_bioinformatics_algorithms_-_jones_pevzner.pdf.

Each student or pair was given access to the list of peptide sequences and was assigned to find motifs corresponding to toxic peptides. Their results are listed in 418Motifs.csv, as well as the algorithms used and method of filtering the data. Their motifs were also inputted into ampScanner (https://www.dveltri.com/ascan/), an AMP predicter, in order to measure their significance against another metric. CS418MotifComparison.csv lists which motifs found by students matched motifs found by PepSeq.
