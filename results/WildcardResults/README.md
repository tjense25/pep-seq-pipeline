Before our analysis on the PepSeq data, another bioinformatics student, Alex, did a separate motif finding approach. We do not know how he obtained his results, but these are the files and how they compared with our motifs (percentage that matched at least one of our motifs):


3mer, 0 wildcards: 94%

4mer, 1 wildcard: 98%

5mer, 1 wildcard: 100%

5mer, 2 wildcards: 100%

6mer, 2 wildcards: 94%
